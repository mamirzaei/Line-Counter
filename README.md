# Line-Counter
A project written in C# by which you can see files names and files line count from the specified path in a list view control and also save list view contents in the file if you want.

About seven years ago I was developing a C# decktop and a java web server projects. 
After a while one day I decided to count lines of code files. I run windows calculator and started opening code 
files one by one and calculating their lines by means of window calculator. 

It took me about 20 minutes to find out what total lines of codes was.
I thought if I wanted to calculate once agian it would be boaring task , so I decided to write an simple application to solve 
this problem.

Please use it and let me know your opinion about it.

Thanks a lot.
